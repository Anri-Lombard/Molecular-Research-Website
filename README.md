## Getting Started

To run the website use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To modify the decoders section, modify `src/app/decoders`, and add this folder if it's not there yet. Similarly, to modify the tokenizers section, modify `src/app/tokenizers`, and add this folder if it's not there yet.

Push to GitHub on a different branch just for safety, then we can merge it in.
