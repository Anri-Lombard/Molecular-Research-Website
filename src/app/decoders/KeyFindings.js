// Our experimentation revealed several key findings. Firstly, it was
// found that this task is an open-ended generation task. This makes
// sampling-based methods more suitable than search-based approaches.
// A notable contrast in performance metrics emerged between these
// search and sampling-based methods. Sampling-based methods con-
// sistently outperformed search-based methods across all metrics
// except with the small modelâ€™s QED score, where search-based meth-
// ods performed comparably, but demonstrated poor diversity.
// Moreover, under temperature sampling, the generated output
// quality begins to degrade when the hyper-parameter exceeds 1 for
// both the small and large models, suggesting that while creativity is
// essential for this task, it requires some form of guidance. Interest-
// ingly, adding a repetition penalty improved performance only for
// the large model.
// Search-based methods often produced high SA scores alongside
// low QED scores. Furthermore top-p sampling required a high hyper-
// parameter to match the uniqueness score of the default model, while
// temperature sampling generated unique molecules with a much
// lower hyper-parameter. Moreover, top-p consistently resulted in
